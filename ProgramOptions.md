The main differences between `GetOpt_pp` and [Boost.ProgramOptions](http://www.boost.org/doc/html/program_options.html), and other similar tools, are:

  * Less code to type: you don't need to pre-register all the options, and then check one by one;
  * Instead, get the options as you need them, in the stream-like manner
  * Simplicity: you just need to learn the manipulators (`Option`, and `OptionPresent`). If you know streams (bet you do), you know `GetOpt_pp`


It's not about one being better than the other. It's just about requirements of different needs.
